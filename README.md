# Mini Project Landing Page

## How we created a webpage that collects a visitor's contact information:
1. We created an html document and we created a <form> tag with two inputs labeled with:
The first one: "Name:" so the users will be able to type their names inside that input.
The second one: "Email:" so the userrs will be able to type their email inside the input.
2. We created a submit button bellow the inputs inside a <div> so the user will be able to send his or her contact information after filling the inputs.

## How we created a header and a footer:
1. At the begining of the html document body we created a <header> semantic tag to fill it with our <nav> links and put style to it.
2.-At the end of the html document body we created a <footer> semantic tag to fill it with our "company name" and to add some style to it.

## How we created an image with a caption
1. We created a <figure> semantic tag and inside it we created an img tag with the image src on it, an alternative phrase for the image in case that for some reason is not displayed and after it we created a <figcaption> tag to make a caption for the image all this inside the <figure> tag.

## How we created the contact form:
1. We created a <form> tag with two inputs labeled with:
The first one: "Name:" so the users will be able to type their names inside that input.
The second one: "Email:" so the userrs will be able to type their email inside the input.
2. We created a submit button bellow the inputs inside a <div> so the user will be able to send his or her contact information after filling the inputs.
